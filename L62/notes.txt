* Tree is type of non-linear data structure.
* One node can be linked to multiple nodes.

Node: An element or entity of a tree.
Root node: The top node of a tree.
Child node: A descendant of any node.
Parent node: A node which is a predecessor of any node.
Sibling node: Nodes which have common parent node.
Ancestor node: Either the parent of the node or the parent of some ancestor of the node.
Descendant node: Either a child of the node or a child of some descendant of the node.
Leaf node: A node that does not have any child node.

Node structure:
    node {
        int data;
        list <node*> child;
    }

Binary tree: A tree whose nodes can have maximum two children.
Height of the tree: Longest path between root node and leaf node.
Diameter or Width of a tree: The number of nodes on the longest path between 2 end nodes.

Traversal Types:
1. In-order: LNR
2. Post-order: LRN
3. Pre-order: NLR
